Deployment recommendations:
1. Host: Vercel (recommended) or Netlify for static hosting. For traditional hosting use any cPanel host.
2. To deploy on Vercel:
   - Create a Vercel account.
   - Import a new project from Git (push this folder to a GitHub repo).
   - Set root to the repository and deploy. Vercel will auto-detect a static site.
3. Domain:
   - Buy a domain from Namecheap/GoDaddy or local registrar.
   - Point DNS (A/CNAME) to the hosting provider following their instructions.
4. To enable contact form backend, either integrate with Formspree / Getform or add a serverless function.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a GitHub repo structure for you,
- Create deployment configuration for Vercel,
- Produce marketing copy and image assets,
- Configure a sample serverless contact endpoint.
